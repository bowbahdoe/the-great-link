# The Great Link

⚠️⚠️I cannot legally call this Java. It has not passed an Oracle ("TM" (™), "C" (©), and "R" (®)) [JCK](https://openjdk.org/groups/conformance/JckAccess/).
So this isn't Java.
Remember that - this is not Java. Under no circumstances should this be mistaken with Java. This is not Java.
Do not call it Java.⚠️⚠️

Java is known for, among other things, its Batteries-Included Standard Library.
This is pathetic. You can't do anything with a battery except lick them. As much
as I like licking a battery, I love sniffing petrol more.

So what if "Java" came with the whole goddamn Hybrid Honda Pilot? Every library you could want
already included. No need to download anything more. No need to think. No need to choose.

*You shall never want for anything ever again.*

A benefit of this sort of approach is that I could keep
track of the maintenance status of the component libraries,
make sure they all work together, and respond to security
vulnerabilities on your behalf. There could even be documentation
on how specifically to use everything together maintained in one central place
or a centralized fund to make sure every library developer is appropriately compensated
for their open source work. All you would need to do is
keep your copy of the great link up to date!

Now am I doing any of that? No.
But I could. Pay me lots and lots of money and I'll do it. 
Consider the potential.

There are four qualities that a library must have to be included
in The Great Link.

* The licensing must allow for it.
* The library must be directly usable with `jlink` so that it may be linked.
* It can't step on the toes of any other libraries. For example, there can only be [one logging implementation](https://github.com/jstachio/rainbowgum).
* It must pass my rigorous "looks good to me" test. This is a test where the me is I and it must to I look good to me.


This means that there are some honestly pretty useless libraries not included - like "The Postgres JDBC Driver" and "All of Spring."
This is clearly their loss. If you care, [take it up with them](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/18079) and
be prepared to do some work yourself.

## How to Drink The Link

Download the link for your platform of choice, have your
developers use it when developing your app, then link down to the
libraries you actually used when deploying your app.

⚠️If you have any trouble with these, ⚠️
- [Windows x86](https://github.com/bowbahdoe/the-great-link/releases/download/v2025.04.01/the-great-link-windows.zip)
- [Max arm](https://github.com/bowbahdoe/the-great-link/releases/download/v2025.04.01/the-great-link-macos.tar.gz)
- [Linux x86](https://github.com/bowbahdoe/the-great-link/releases/download/v2025.04.01/the-great-link-ubuntu.tar.gz)

That last step won't work yet, but if it did then there would be basically no downside.
